sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:Because as we know, in random, reversed and large sorted data Bubble sort takes more time than selection or Merge sort and take lees time in sotred small data. And here the longest time for sorting reversed and random files and smallest time to sorting small (5000, 10000) sorted files belongs to sort1. So it's Bubble sort.


sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Because as we know, Merg sort takes less time than selection or bubble sort in reversed, random and large sorted data and has max sort time that it needs is n log n compred to n^2. And here the shortest time for sorting reversed and random files belongs to sort2. So it's Merge sort.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: It,s between merge and bubble sort in random, reversed files so it's selection sort, and it's the slowest in sorted file.
