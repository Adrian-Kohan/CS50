It's a bit difficult for me to answer this question because I don't have a specific idea for it, but what I think is that considering the average tempo and length of the song can also be effective because it doesn't depend only on the three factors mentioned.
Because sometimes the memories we have of songs make them attractive to us and this is not something that can be easily simulated. Maybe instead of averaging the top 100 songs of one year, it would be better to use the top 100 songs of the past few years (for example, 3 years).
